## Hey there, I'm Carol! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm thrilled to have you here. Allow me to introduce myself and give you a glimpse into my journey as a Java/Kotlin backend developer.

#### About Me

- 💻 In 2018, I enrolled in a **Web Development** Bootcamp, which opened the doors to my career in the tech industry.
- ☕️ Following that bootcamp, I ventured into a role as a **Java backend developer**, and over time, I also delved into learning **Kotlin**.
- 🚀 Currently enrolled in a *full stack bootcamp* sponsored by Santander and DIO, I am improving my Java and Angular skills.
- 🐍 Additionally, I am exploring Python domains through a course offered by IBM in collaboration with Mastertech.
- 🧙‍♂️ I'm currently working on a game of battles and missions, based on the universe of The Lord of the Rings, in Java
